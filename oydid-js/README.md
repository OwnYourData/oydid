OYDID provides a self-sustained environment for managing decentralised identifiers (DIDs). The did:oyd method links the identifier cryptographically to the DID Document and through also cryptographically linked provenance information in a public log it ensures resolving to the latest valid version of the DID Document.

The oydid library allows you to create, resolve, update, and deactivate did:oyd DIDs.

## Installation

```bash
npm install oydid
```
