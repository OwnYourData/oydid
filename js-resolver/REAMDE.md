# `did:oyd` Resolver

This library is intended to use [OYDID](https://github.com/oydeu/oydid) as fully self-managed Decentralized Identifiers and wrap them in a DID Document

It supports the proposed [Decentralized Identifiers](https://w3c.github.io/did-core/#identifier) spec from the [W3C Credentials Community Group](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/).

It requires the [`did-resolver`](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/did-resolver) library, which is the primary interface for resolving DIDs.
