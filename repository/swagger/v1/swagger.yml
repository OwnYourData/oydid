     OYDID (Own Your Digital IDentifier) provides a self-sustained environment for managing digital identifiers (DIDs). The oyd:did method links the identifier cryptographically to the DID Document and through also cryptographically linked provenance information in a public log it ensures resolving to the latest valid version of the DID Document.
